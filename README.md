# find-four-leaf-clovers
This code needs Jetson Nano, arduino Uno and realsense camera. Arduino Uno connects a stepper motor to control the open/close of a gripper, it also connects other sensors to give feedback (sound, vision). Jetson Nano connects a RGB-D sensor which is used to capture images for finding the four-leaf clovers among a clutch of leaves.
